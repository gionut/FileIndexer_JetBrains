Once upon a time there lived a king and queen who were very unhappy because they 
had no children. But at last a little daughter was born, and their sorrow was turned to joy. 
All the bells in the land were rung to tell the glad tidings.The king gave a christening feast so grand 
that the like of it had never been known. He invited all the fairies he could find in the kingdom—there were seven of them—to 
come to the christening as godmothers. He hoped that each would give the princess a good gift. 
When the christening was over, the feast came. Before each of the fairies was placed a plate with a spoon, a knife, and a fork—all 
pure gold. But alas! As the fairies were about to seat themselves at the table, there came into 
he hall a very old fairy who had not been invited. She had left the kingdom fifty years before and had not been seen or heard of until this day.
