Once upon a time there lived a king and
queen who were very unhappy because they
had no children. But at last a little daughter
was born, and their sorrow was turned to joy.
All the bells in the land were rung to tell the
glad tidings.
The king gave a christening feast so grand
that the like of it had never been known. He
invited all the fairies he could find in the
kingdom—there were seven of them—to
come to the christening as godmothers. He
hoped that each would give the princess a
good gift.
When the christening was over, the feast
came. Before each of the fairies was placed a
plate with a spoon, a knife, and a fork—all
pure gold. But alas! As the fairies were about
to seat themselves at the table, there came into
the hall a very old fairy who had not been
vited. She had left the kingdom fifty years before and had not been seen or heard of until
this day.
The king at once ordered that a plate should
be brought for her, but he could not furnish a
gold one such as the others had. This made the
old fairy angry, and she sat there muttering to
herself.
A young fairy who sat near overheard her
angry threats. This good godmother, fearing the
old fairy might give the child an unlucky gift,
hid herself behind a curtain. She did this because she wished to speak last and perhaps be
able to change the old fairy’s gift.
At the end of the feast, the youngest fairy
stepped forward and said, “The princess shall
be the most beautiful woman in the world.”
The second said,
“She shall have a temper as sweet as an angel.”
