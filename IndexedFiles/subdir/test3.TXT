At last the prince came to a chamber of
gold, where he saw upon a bed the fairest sight
one ever beheld—a princess of about seventeen years who looked as if she had just fallen
asleep. Trembling, the prince knelt beside her,
and awakened her with a kiss. And now the enchantment was broken.
The princess looked at him with wondering eyes and said: “Is it you, my prince? I have
waited for you long.”
So happy were the two that they talked
hour after hour. In the meantime all in the
palace awaked and each began to do what he
was doing when he fell asleep. The gentlemen
went on bowing to the ladies. The ladies went
on with their embroidery. The grooms went on
currying their horses, the cook went on slapping the kitchen boy, and the servants began to
serve the supper. Then the chief lady in waiting,
who was ready to die of hunger, told the princess aloud that supper was ready.
The prince gave the princess his hand, and
they all went into the great hall for supper. That
very evening the prince and princess were married. The next day the prince took his bride to
his father’s palace, and there they lived happily
ever afterward.
A great many changes take place in a hundred years. The king had no other child, and
when he died, his throne passed to another royal family. Even the story of the sleeping princess
was almost forgotten.
One day the son of the king who was then
reigning was out hunting, and he saw towers
rising above a thick wood. He asked what they
were, but no one could answer him.
At last an old peasant was found who said,
“Your highness, fifty years ago my father told
me that there is a castle in the woods where a
princess sleeps—the most beautiful princess that
ever lived. It was said that she must sleep there
a hundred years, when she would be awakened
by a king’s son.”
At this the young prince determined to find
out the truth for himself. He leaped from his
horse and began to force his way through the
wood. To his astonishment, the stiff branches
gave way, and then closed again, allowing none
of his companions to follow.
A beautiful palace rose before him. In the
courtyard the prince saw horses and men who
looked as if they were dead. But he was not
afraid and boldly entered the palace. There were
guards motionless as stone, gentlemen and ladies, pages and footmen
